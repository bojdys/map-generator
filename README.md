# map-generator

#### Description
The app generates a nxn map, where n is set by the user. The app generates random start and meta points and obstacles of sizes: 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2. A user sets the number of obstacles and chooses if they are allowed to bind with each other. The app finds and shows the shortest way from the start point to the meta point omitting obstacles. It uses Dijkstra and AStar algorithms. Map can be saved and loaded.
